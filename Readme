The prediction model file classifies each headline into neutral/bear/bull. study the code and modify it to concatenate RSI and MACD  into the embedding vector generated by finbert.
play around with the threshold which is currently 0.5% for labeling, check the labellings generated for each threshold, if it is a lot of neutral signals or bear/bull signals. 
  try a diff labeling method if u find a mistake here.
